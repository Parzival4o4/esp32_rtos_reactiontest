# Reaction Test for ESP32

A simple reaction time tester for the ESP32, written using the ESP-IDF framework.

Press the button to start the game. After a random delay, you'll be prompted to press it again as quickly as possible. The reaction time is measured and printed over serial.

Created as a learning project to get hands-on experience with FreeRTOS, tasks, interrupts, and timing on embedded systems.
